run app.js first as node app.js device_id, it requires the request module.
This will return the sensor id, latitude and longitude.

The map.html will give the location of the sample device in map, powered by mapbox api.

app.js and map.html haven't been linked yet so it won't automatically update the map data. The latitude, longitude and sensor id are made as constants in it.
